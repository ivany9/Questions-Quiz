Quiz Game 
A quiz game developed in Javascript which tests a player's Knowledge of Javascript. The game consists of 4 rounds of questions. Each question has only one correct answer.The timer starts running when the user loads the web page, starting at 50 seconds, and counting down in seconds. When the player chooses the correct answer the page shows that it is correct and 10 seconds is added to the player's time. When the player selects an incorrect answer the page shows that it is the wrong answer and 10 seconds is deducted from the player's remaing time. If the player can not answer within the allocated time the player's remaining time goes down to 0, and the player loses the game. When the player loses the game the screen shows a score card that shows the player the game is over and their score is 0. If the player answers all the questions before the countdown gets to 0, the player receives a score, and their score along with their remaining time appears on the score card time. Once the game is finished the player can save their name on the score card and check their score. An option to play again is available by clicking on the play again button. Once a player clicks on the buttom the game is restarted and timer reset at 50 seconds.

The current project was developed for educational purposes and there was an attempt to use the best practices and we tried to make the code easily expandable.
